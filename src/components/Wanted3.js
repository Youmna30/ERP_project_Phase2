                              The Australian Government expects us to be adaptable
                              <br/> and to respond effectively to the growing number and
                              <br/>diverse nature of threats facing Australia and its citizens.
                              <br/> Our work can involve collecting intelligence relating to
                              <br/>national defence, international relations and economic
                              <br/>issues. We also contribute to Australias coordinated
                              <br/> national efforts against terrorism, proliferation of weapons of
                              <br/> mass destruction, and trans-national issues
                              <br/> such as people smuggling.
